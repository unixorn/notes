# Interview questions for Hiring Managers

> I've started trying to compile a list of harder, more thought provoking questions to ask during interview to hiring managers to really probe out how the team and organization works, and not just the standard list of soft-ball questions you throw to be nice.


- How are you rewarded for the work you do?
- How is your org structured? How do you resolve conflicts between conflicting groups with the org?
- Tell me about some of the strengths of the people on your team
- What drives your engineers to do their best work?
- How do you manage low performers?
- How do you measure the performance of this team?
- What are some of the largest gaps that exist on your team?
- What is the most important goal for your team over the next quarter?
- Can you tell me about a time you've had to resolve a serious conflict in this org?
- How are decisions made about what technology to use?
- How are post-mortems run?
- What does the executive of the hiring team know about the position?
- Are you at liberty to share why the last 3 people left this team (or role)?
- How are people supported in their current role?
- How often are engineers encouraged to reduce toil?
- Is there an active effort to pay down technical debt?
- Do you hire Junior engineers? How do you handle mentoring and growing them?
- How has your business adapted and cared for its employees during the Coronavirus pandemic?

Please feel free to add/remove any good ones you have started using!
